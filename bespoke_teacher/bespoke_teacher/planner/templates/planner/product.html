        <h1>The Planner</h1>
        <p>
            At the beginning of it all was the desire to have a planner that can 
            just be used, without the need for filling in all the necessary dates 
            and classes and classrooms. Because we have computers to do all that, 
            don't we?
        </p>

        <p>
            The heart of the bespoke teacher planner is the diary pages. One page 
            for each school day, laid out with the structure of your school, with 
            your lessons already filled in. If your school lunchtime is a moveable 
            feast - mine is period 4a or 4b depending on my classes, the pages will
            show that.

            You can choose between a day to a page, or a week to a double spread.

            The second most important part of the planner is marksheets.  The 
            marksheets have as many rows they need.  If you have 40 kids in a 
            class (poor you) there's space for all their names, but if you are 
            lucky enough to be in a school with a class size of 25, you won't
            have 45 narrow lines on your marksheet pages. There's a vertical 
            space to record what you are marking, and a space for a date or 
            week number.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            Also important are note pages to write things down.  We're big fans of 
            <a href="bulletjournal.com">Bullet Journal</a>s, which is why the
            pages have dots.  Follow the link to find out what that's about if
            you don't know.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There are some note pages at the front, and plenty at the back. If you 
            select week-to-a-view you get more of them to compensate for less 
            space to scribble in the diary pages. All the pages in the planner are numbered. 
            This is very important. If you write a great idea for a lesson or scheme of work, 
            you want to know where to find it.  We use the first two note pages for 
            a contents page.
        </p>

            Finally, or firstly in terms of where it is in the planner, on page 1
            is the teacher's timetable.  The planner is in black and white, but you 
            can colour the timetable in.
