            <p>
                The first bespoke teacher planner has arrived! 
                Okay, so this is just the prototype I need to show 
                school management it's a viable proposition. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In my hands it is heavy and I immediately know 
                ordering the higher quality paper is not only a 
                waste of money but makes for an inferior product. 
                And the cover is testament to my colour blindness,
                 but it's a start.
